## Credits

-   This is based on [Byungjin Park](https://github.com/posquit0)'s [Awsome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV?tab=readme-ov-file) and the full credit goes to him for the template.
    (_My one is a stripped down version of it and his project offers a very granular control, more components and a cover letter template also._)
